## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Scenario 1: Upgrade to Premium Model
**Cost Impact:** +${cost_increase} per request (+{percentage_increase}%)
**Quality Impact:** +{quality_improvement} points (from {current_quality} to {new_quality})
**Monthly Cost Impact:** +${monthly_increase}

**Break-even Analysis:**
- **Quality improvement per dollar:** {quality_per_dollar}
- **Recommended if:** [Specific scenarios where upgrade is worth it]
- **ROI timeframe:** [When benefits justify costs]

### Scenario 2: Downgrade to Budget Model
**Cost Impact:** -${cost_decrease} per request (-{percentage_decrease}%)
**Quality Impact:** -{quality_decrease} points (from {current_quality} to {new_quality})
**Monthly Savings:** ${monthly_savings}

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Acceptable quality threshold:** {min_acceptable_quality}/10
- **Risk level:** [Low/Medium/High]
- **Mitigation strategies:** [How to maintain quality with budget model]

### Scenario 3: Hybrid Approach
**Strategy:** Use different models for different task complexities
**Implementation:**
- **Simple tasks** → Budget model (Est. {simple_percentage}% of requests)
- **Complex tasks** → Premium model (Est. {complex_percentage}% of requests)

**Projected Savings:** ${hybrid_savings} per month ({hybrid_percentage}% reduction)
**Quality Impact:** Minimal (smart routing maintains quality where needed)
