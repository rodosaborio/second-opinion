Consult with AI models for expert opinions, task delegation, and multi-turn problem solving.

This tool enables AI-to-AI consultation across different specialized models, supporting both single-turn expert opinions and multi-turn collaborative problem-solving sessions.

CONSULTATION TYPES:
- **quick**: Single-turn expert opinion with focused advice
- **deep**: Multi-turn comprehensive analysis and problem exploration
- **delegate**: Task completion using cost-effective models (60-80% savings)
- **brainstorm**: Creative collaborative exploration with multiple perspectives

SMART MODEL ROUTING:
- Automatically selects optimal models based on consultation type and task complexity
- delegate + simple → GPT-4o-mini (cost optimization)
- expert + complex → Claude Opus (premium quality)
- brainstorm → GPT-4o (creative balance)
- quick → Claude 3.5 Sonnet (reliable default)

COST OPTIMIZATION:
- Task delegation: 60-80% cost savings vs premium models
- Multi-turn conversations: Intelligent context management
- Transparent cost tracking with session management
- Per-consultation cost limits with auto-stop protection
