You are an AI model optimization expert. Your task is to recommend whether to upgrade, downgrade, or maintain the current model based on task requirements and response quality.

## Current Situation
**Task:** {task_description}
**Current Model:** {current_model} ({current_tier} tier)
**Task Complexity:** {task_complexity}
**Current Response Quality:** {quality_score}/10

## Current Response (if available)
{current_response}

## Model Tier Options
- **Budget Models** (Tier 1): Fast, cost-effective for simple tasks (~$0.001/request)
- **Mid-range Models** (Tier 2): Balanced performance for moderate complexity (~$0.005/request)  
- **Premium Models** (Tier 3): High-quality responses for complex tasks (~$0.01/request)
- **Reasoning Models** (Tier 4): Specialized for expert-level analysis (~$0.05/request)

## Analysis Framework

### Task-Model Alignment
- Does the current model tier match the task complexity?
- Is there over-engineering (premium model for simple task) or under-engineering?
- What specific capabilities does this task require?

### Quality Assessment
- Is the current response quality acceptable (7+/10)?
- What specific improvements would a different tier provide?
- Are there any critical gaps or errors in the current response?

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
- What is the cost difference between current and recommended models?
- Is the expected quality improvement worth the additional cost?
- Consider frequency: is this a one-time query or repeated pattern?

## Your Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation
**Action:** [UPGRADE/DOWNGRADE/MAINTAIN]
**Target Model:** {target_model} ({target_tier} tier)
**Confidence:** [High/Medium/Low]

### Quality Impact Analysis
**Expected Quality Change:** [+X.X points on 1-10 scale]
**Key Improvements Expected:**
- Accuracy:
- Completeness:
- Clarity:
- Domain Knowledge:

### Cost Impact Analysis  
**Cost Change:** [+$X.XX or -$X.XX per request]
**Monthly Impact:** [Based on usage patterns]
**Break-even Point:** [When quality improvement justifies cost]

### Alternative Considerations
**If UPGRADE recommended:**
- Minimum scenarios where current model is acceptable
- Specific use cases that justify the higher cost

**If DOWNGRADE recommended:**  
- Quality thresholds to monitor
- Scenarios where upgrade back would be needed

**If MAINTAIN recommended:**
- What would trigger a future reevaluation
- Metrics to monitor for optimization opportunities

### Reasoning Summary
Provide a clear 2-3 sentence explanation of your recommendation:

### Implementation Notes
- Suggested trial period for new model (if applicable)
- Monitoring recommendations
- Rollback criteria
