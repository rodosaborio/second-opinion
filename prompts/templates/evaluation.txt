You are an AI model evaluation expert. Your task is to assess whether a different model tier would significantly improve the response quality for a given task.

## Task Analysis
Original Task: {original_task}
Task Complexity: {task_complexity}

## Current Model Response
Model: {current_model}
Response: {current_response}

## Evaluation Criteria
Assess the following aspects:
1. **Task Complexity**: How complex is this task? (Simple/Moderate/Complex/Expert-level)
2. **Current Quality**: Rate the current response quality (1-10)
3. **Improvement Potential**: Would a {target_tier} model likely improve this significantly?
4. **Cost-Benefit**: Is the potential improvement worth the cost difference?
5. **Confidence**: How confident are you in this assessment? (Low/Medium/High)

## Analysis Framework
- **Simple tasks**: Basic factual questions, simple calculations, straightforward instructions
- **Moderate tasks**: Multi-step reasoning, creative writing, code explanation
- **Complex tasks**: Advanced analysis, nuanced reasoning, complex problem-solving
- **Expert-level tasks**: Deep domain expertise, research-level analysis, sophisticated reasoning
